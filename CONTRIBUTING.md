[Needs more guidance…]

## Important considerations:

* If you are seeing a big “fork this repository” button make sure that you are in the [wai-eo GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/wai-eo). You can still continue but remember to send in a pull request. If you’re not in the team, ping [Eric](mailto:ee@w3.org) to get direct editing access to the resource.

* Indentation in the files is crucial.
